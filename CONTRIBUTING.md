# Contributing to ShipRentalFastApi
Thank you for your interest in our project! We would like to encourage you to contribute to its development. Below you'll find information on how to collaborate with us.

## Contribution Process
1. Check the issue tracker and open issues to make sure the problem you want to work on isn't already in progress [ClickUp](https://sharing.clickup.com/9015557545/b/h/6-901504164692-2/bdb3443a77bb105).
2. Fork the repository and create your branch 
   `git checkout -b ticket_number_ticket_description`
3. Make changes to the code and run tests
4. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a description of the changes made and a link to the relevant issue
5. Await review and possible suggestions from the project team
   
## Code Style
Before getting started, it's worth familiarizing yourself with our code style guidelines (PEP8) and we try to implement Twelve-Factor App:

These are the 12 rules that can significantly enhance the quality and scalability of your application:

1. Codebase: Maintain only one codebase repository.
2. Dependencies: Utilize a requirements.txt file or package manager (e.g., pip) for managing dependencies.
3. Configuration: Store configuration settings separately, such as in a .env file.
4. Backing Services: Ensure all components are replaceable, such as using an ORM for database abstraction.
5. Build, Release, Run: Keep the process streamlined without requiring additional steps.
6. Processes: Python isn't fully equipped for this, but processes should be independent for horizontal scaling.
7. Port Binding: The application should bind to ports for communication.
8. Concurrency: Enable both vertical and horizontal scaling to manage concurrency effectively.
9. Disposability: Enable quick start-up and shut-down processes for easy scaling.
10. Development/Production Parity: Maintain identical environments across all stages.
11. Logs: Emit logs to standard output for efficient monitoring.
12. Admin Processes: Store all administrative scripts within the repository for consistency.


### Use clean and understandable code
Maintain consistency with existing code in the project
